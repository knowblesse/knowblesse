Hi, I'm Dr. Ji Hoon Jeong, a postdoctoral associate from the Department of Neuroscience at Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.

I began coding for fun because I enjoyed automation, creating new things, and exploring the innovations of other great minds. 
Although my research demands a significant amount of coding, I still love the process itself.

As I am self-taught in coding, I might lack fundamental software design knowledge and could make mistakes in a collaborative environment. 

If you ever notice such moments, please kindly point them out. It will greatly benefit my future projects. 

I believe it's better to have many flaws identified than to be overlooked entirely.

Thank you for visiting this page!
