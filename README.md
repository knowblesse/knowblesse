Hi, Iâ€™m @knowblesse currently in integrated doctoral course in behavioral neuroscience.
I'm interested in so many topics, but mainly my research focus is creating a neuro-inspired computational algorithm.
I also utilize computational tools from the ML field to translate neural data into human-understandable form.
I'm working on my own project of home automation for fun and I love to use what I've learnt into my own life. 

I'm desperate to find someone like me, love coding, design electronic circuits, build stuff with 3D printer, etc..., 
so please contact me if you have a fun project to share or comments for my work. 

Thank you!
